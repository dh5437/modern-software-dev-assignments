## YOUR RESPONSES
### Automation #1
a. Design inspiration (e.g. cite the best-practices and/or sub-agents docs)
> TODO

b. Design of each automation, including goals, inputs/outputs, steps
> TODO

c. How to run it (exact commands), expected outputs, and rollback/safety notes
> TODO

d. Before vs. after (i.e. manual workflow vs. automated workflow)
> TODO

e. How you used the automation to enhance the starter application
> I used the automation to read and execute `/docs/TASKS.md` sequentially. It structured the work into clear steps, reduced manual tracking, and ensured each task was completed in order. Concretely, it added case-insensitive note search, note edit/delete, validation and error handling, improved extraction logic with tags, expanded tests, and updated frontend behavior and API docs.
